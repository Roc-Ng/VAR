## UCF-Crime Captions
UCFCrime-AR Captions are released to facilitate future research.
## Features
[I3D features of UCFCrime-AR](https://stuxidianeducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pengwu_stu_xidian_edu_cn/EvYcZ5rQZClGs_no2g-B0jcB4ynsonVQIreHIojNnUmPyA?e=xNrGxc)

[I3D&VGGish features of XDViolence-AR](https://roc-ng.github.io/XD-Violence/)

## Highlight
- We introduce a new task named video anomaly retrieval to bridge the gap between the literature and real-world applications in terms of video anomaly analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work moves towards VAR from VAD;
- We present two large-scale benchmarks, i.e., UCFCrime- AR and XDViolence-AR, based on public VAD datasets. The former is applied to video-text VAR, the latter is to video-audio VAR;
- We propose a model called ALAN, aiming at challenges in VAR, where anomaly-led sampling, video prompt based masked phrase modeling, and cross-modal align- ment are introduced for the attention of anomalous segments, enhancement of fine-grained associations, and multi-perspective match, respectively.
